# ResourceSyncSharp
A library implementing the ResourceSync sitemap-based resource synchronisation protocol.

I originally wrote for my (now ex-)employer Exclaimer Ltd, but it was never deployed there, and they very kindly agreed to donate it to the public domain for the greater good, being the awesome people they are. (If you need corporate signature branding, they are the best in the world, go check them out at http://www.exclaimer.com).
